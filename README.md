Consumers as Creators

"Consumers as Creators: Understanding the annotation needs of the scientific community through the domain of botany" is a project whose goals are to analyze botanical researchersâ€™ annotation needs and develop a prototype of how those needs may be met within a digital library platform." 

This project was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (LG-87-18-0057-18).
